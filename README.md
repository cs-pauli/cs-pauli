### How did I get here?

After working as a Digital Project Manager, specially during the Pandemic, creating and improving digital platforms to host virtual events, I figured out that I loved the digital side of it, and more precisely, I enjoyed a lot the data analysis part of each project. So I left it all and started a bootcamp on Data Analysis, started to work with PYTHON, SQL and TABLEAU, and just like that I reconfirmed my passion, the DATA world.
My goal now as an employee is to continue learning on this amazing job and to develop my broad skills in Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
